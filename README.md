# **ELT Movies Data Warehouse & Analysis Project** üé¨üìä

## **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **ELT Movies Data Warehouse & Analysis** project! This initiative demonstrates the complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process applied to a large dataset of movie information. Using **Talend** for ETL, we transform raw movie data from IMDb into a structured database, enabling efficient analysis and insightful visualizations. The database is then linked to **Power BI** to create interactive dashboards, presenting data insights about movie trends, performance, and key metrics.

This project focuses on 10,850 movies, providing a comprehensive overview of the movie industry across various dimensions like genres, cast, directors, ratings, and more.

### **Key Features** 
‚ú® **ETL Process**:
- **Extract**: Movie data from Kaggle website.
- **Transform**: Cleanse and aggregate the data using **Talend** to fit the database schema.
- **Load**: Store the cleaned and structured data in a relational database for efficient querying.

üì¶ **Data Warehouse Design**:
- **Star Schema**: Includes dimension tables for categories like movies, genres, and production companies, with a central fact table for movie statistics (ratings, revenue, etc.).

üìä **Power BI Dashboards**:
- Visualizations of movie trends, ratings, and revenue.
- Interactive analysis of movie genres, top directors, and studios.
